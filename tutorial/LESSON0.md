## Tutorial - Lesson 0

Let's take a look at the structure of Legit.

```python
def lesson0(a = 1):
    a = a + 1
    return a
```

This is the first function for everyone to learn Legit.

The first line `def lesson0(a = 1):` shows the name of the function.

The name of this function is `lesson0`.

It also declares that the variable `a` is `1` with `a = 1`.

The second line `a = a + 1` is the first and only variable operation expression.

The third line `return a` is the output line.
